CS336: Sampling-Based Motion Planning with a Single Goal Region</a></h2>
The objective is to compute a collision-free path from an initial placement of the robot to a goal region while avoiding collisions with obstacles. The robot can translate and rotate. You can implement either a standard roadmap-based approach (e.g., PRM, OBPRM, GaussianPRM, BridgePRM), a standard tree-based approach (e.g., RRT, EST), or your own sampling-based algorithm which builds upon the standard algorithms.<p>
<b>Testing</b>: You need to run your algorithm <code>3</code> times on each of the following scenes: <code>scene1a.txt</code>, <code>scene2a.txt</code>, <code>scene3a.txt</code>. Set the maximum time of each run to 120s. Prepare a table with the results, i.e., for each of the 3 runs on each scene indicate whether the motion planner solved the problem in the alloted time and if so how much time did it actually take.<p>
<b>Note</b>: 15pts will be taken off if you do not include the results table with your submission.<p>
<b>Extra Credit</b>: Students in CS336 can gain extra credit by doing the assignment for CS436 instead of the assignment for CS336. In such case, your assignment will be graded out of 115 points.<h2><a class="anchor" name="secCS436">
CS436: Sampling-Based Motion Planning with Multiple Goal Regions</a></h2>
There are several goal regions, G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>, ..., G<sub>m</sub>. Each goal region G<sub>i</sub> is associated with a reward R<sub>i</sub>. The objective is to compute a collision-free path from that maximizes the total rewards accumulated along the path. More specifically, when the robot reaches the goal region G<sub>i</sub>, the robot gets the reward R<sub>i</sub> associated with G<sub>i</sub>. The total reward collected along a path is equal to the sum of the rewards of the goal regions reached by the robot along the path. So, if a path A reaches goal regions G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>4</sub>, G<sub>8</sub>, the total reward collected by the robot along the path A is R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>4</sub> + R<sub>8</sub>.<p>
You should strive to develop a sampling-based motion-planning method that, given an upper bound on computation time, computes a path that avoids collisions and collects as high rewards as possible. Note that you do not need to develop a new sampling-based motion-planning method from scratch. You will be able to obtain good results by adapting standard sampling-based approaches (either roadmap or tree approaches).<p>
<b>Algorithm Description</b>: 15pts will be taken off if you do not include the description of your algorithm with your submission.<p>
<b>Testing</b>: You need to run your algorithm <code>3</code> times on each of the following scenes: <code>scene1b.txt</code>, <code>scene2c.txt</code>, <code>scene3d.txt</code>. Set the maximum time of each run to 120s. Prepare a table with the results, i.e., for each of the 3 runs on each scene indicate the total rewards collected by your best solution and the time it took the motion planner to compute such a path.<p>
<b>Note</b>: 15pts will be taken off if you do not include the results table with your submission.<p>
<b>Extra Credit</b>: Results on <code>scene3d.txt</code> will be used for extra credit. Specifically, your algorithms will be ranked based on the total rewards accumulated for all 3 runs on <code>scene3d.txt</code>. Note that each run is limited to 120s of maximum running time. In case of ties, algorithms with smaller total running times will be ranked higher. Extra credit will then be given as follows:<ul>
<li>+15pts for the best algorithm</li><li>+10pts for the 2nd best algorithm</li><li>+5pts for the 3rd best algorithm</li><li>+3pts for the 4th best algorithm</li></ul>

Support Code -- General Description</a></h2>
Support code is provided for this assignment to facilitate your implementation (see documentation for detailed descriptions). The main classes in the support code are the following:<ul>
<li>Utils: provides various utilies for pseudorandom number generation, measuring running time, and polygon-polygon intersections [already implemented]</li><li><a class="el" href="classSimulator.html" title="Problem information.">Simulator</a> : provides access to the robot, the obstacles, and the goal regions [already implemented]</li><li><a class="el" href="classGraphics.html" title="Graphics for running simulation and setting up problem.">Graphics</a> : provides graphical display and interface for running motion planner [already implemented]</li><li><a class="el" href="classMotionPlanner.html" title="Interface for the motion-planning algorithms.">MotionPlanner</a> : interface for your motion planning algorithm [you need to implement it]</li></ul>
<b>CS336 Note</b>: The same simulation code is used for both CS336 and CS436. In CS336, you just need to use the first goal region (scenes scene1a.txt, scene2a.txt, scene3a.txt contain just one goal region).<h2><a class="anchor" name="sec_compiling">
